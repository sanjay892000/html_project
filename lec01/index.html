        <h1>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) </h1>
    </center><br>
    <h1>What is HTML? </h1>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a standard for creating
        web pages. It's a markup language used to structure content on the web, defining elements like
        headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML forms the backbone of web content. In layman's terms,
        HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It's a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display
        text, images, videos, and other elements on a webpage. Think of it as the building blocks that create the
        structure and look of a website, similar to how bricks and mortar are used to build a house. </p>
    <p>HTML is the language of the web, used to create websites. </p>
    <p>HTML defines the barebone structure or layout of web pages that we see on the Internet. </p>
    <p>HTML consists of a set of tags contained within an HTML document, and the associated files
        typically have either a ".html" or ".htm" extension.</p>
    <p>There are several versions of HTML, with HTML5 being the most recent version. </p><br>
    <h2>Why the Term HyperText & Markup Language? </h2>
    <p>The term 'Hypertext Markup Language' is composed of two main words: 'hypertext' and 'markup
        language.' 'Hypertext' refers to the linking of text with other documents, while 'markup language'
        denotes a language that utilizes a specific set of tags. </p><br>
    <h3>Installation & Setup of Visual Studio Code for HTML:</h3>
    <p>We will install and set up HTML to optimize its utility for creating web pages. Additionally, we'll install
        extensions in Visual Studio Code to enhance its functionality. If you're unsure about which editor to use,
        you can confidently start with Visual Studio Code. You won't regret it; it's one of the best free code
        editors available in the market.</p>

        for Windows </p><br>
    <h4>Live Server Extension:</h4>
    <p>In addition, we'll be installing the Live Server extension in our Visual Studio Code editor to view live
        reload pages.

    <p>The Live Server extension is used to launch a local development server with a live reload feature for
        HTML pages. </p><br>
