        <h1><u>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</u> </h1>
    </center><br>
    <h1><u>What is HTML? </u></h1>
    <p><b><big>H</big>TML (HyperText Markup Language)</b>was created by <i>Tim Berners-Lee in 1991</i> as a standard for
        creating
        web pages. <mark>It's a markup language used to structure content on the web</mark> , defining elements like
        headings, paragraphs, links, and images. <strong>HTML forms the backbone of web content</strong>. In layman's
        terms,
        <b>HTML is like the skeleton of a website</b>. <mark>It's a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to
            display</mark>
        text, images, videos, and other elements on a webpage. Think of it as the building blocks that create the
        structure and look of a website, similar to how bricks and mortar are used to build a house.
    </p>
    <p>HTML is the language of the web, used to create websites. </p>
    <p>HTML defines the barebone structure or layout of web pages that we see on the Internet. </p>
    <p>HTML consists of a set of tags contained within an HTML document, and the associated files
        <em>typically have either a ".html" or ".htm" extension.</em>
    </p>
    <p>There are several versions of HTML, with HTML5 being the most recent version. </p><br>
    <h2><u>Why the Term <big>HyperText & Markup Language?</big></u> </h2>
    <p>The term <del>'Hyperlink Markup Language'</del> <mark>'Hypertext Markup Language'</mark> is composed of two main
        words: 'hypertext' and 'markup
        language.' 'Hypertext' refers to the linking of text with other documents, while 'markup language'
        denotes a language that utilizes a specific set of tags. </p><br>
    <h3><u>Installation & Setup of Visual Studio Code for HTML:</u></h3>
